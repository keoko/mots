** keyboard with splitted words does not work
** Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <input.mobile-keyboard-input#mobile-keyboard-input>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <input.mobile-keyboard-input#mobile-keyboard-input> <input type=​"text" id=​"mobile-keyboard-input" class=​"mobile-keyboard-input" autocomplete=​"off" autocorrect=​"off" autocapitalize=​"none" spellcheck=​"false" inputmode=​"text" enterkeyhint=​"go" aria-hidden=​"true">​
