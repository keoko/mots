*** word collections
*** word collections moved to JSON files
*** used FFI to fetch JSON files in JS
had some issues to understand where to place the FFI file, and also the mapping of function names
the FFI should be placed on src/ folder, and when building the app it is moved to the assets folder

*** chatgpt/claude makes mistakes when writing Gleam code like using list.at
list.at function does not exist in Erlang
*** erlang.get_line does not work
I used another package called input, but maybe it could work using external function erlang.get_line, not sure how it works
